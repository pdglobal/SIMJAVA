# SIMJAVA
Secure Instant Messenger using DARTIS in Java


This is a temporary project created for the research and development of an Instant Messaging client, which utilizes HTTPS 256 bit symmetrical encryption, combined with the DARTIS as a stronger(136000000 bits) secondary encryption layer.


This project utilizes the standardized DARTIS keyfile blueprint encryption key structure/format, meaning that the keyfiles used in this version of SIM are valid across both the autoit, and php versions of the DARTIS library.(to see cross compatibility in action, download the autoit version of sim, and this version of sim, and both IM clients should be able to communicate flawlessly with one another, with and without DARTIS encryption)

Please note: This is not a finished product, or even a public release, this repository is solely for the purpose of collaboration to create a fluid and smooth secure IM experience.
